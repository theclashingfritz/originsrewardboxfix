# Reward Box Fix for Origins

(Only works on Plutonium because of ReplaceFunc())

This script fixes some issues with having 8 players in the game.

An example is only 4 people being able to have punches and the rewards and punches being bound to the character index.

This patch has the two reward boxes be different boxes for players 1-4 and players 5-8.

Players 1-4 are supposed to get their rewards at generator 1.
Players 5-8 are supposed to get their rewards at generator 6.

**Installation Guide:**

Install the compiled file to ```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\zm_tomb\```, Otherwise the mod will have issues and crash other maps.
If the folder doesn't exist. Create it and and continue.
